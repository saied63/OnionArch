// important note to delete migration : 

how can i remove migration and re create it 
. it it enough to delete folder and run commands again ?

No — don’t just delete the Migrations folder manually. 
EF Core keeps track of applied migrations 
inside your database in a special table called 
__EFMigrationsHistory.// i saw this in my table
If you only delete the folder, EF will get confused because 
the database still “remembers” the old migrations.
Here are the proper ways:

✅ Option 1: Remove the last migration (before applying it)
If you haven’t run dotnet ef database update yet:
dotnet ef migrations remove -p Infrastructure -s API

👉 This removes the last migration and cleans up properly.
✅ Option 2: Reset everything (start fresh)
If you want to delete all migrations and start again:
Delete the Migrations folder in your project 
(e.g. Infrastructure/Migrations).
Drop the database:

dotnet ef database drop -p Infrastructure -s API
(It will ask for confirmation: type y.)
Create a new migration:
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Infrastructure -s API
Apply it:
dotnet ef database update -p Infrastructure -s API
✅ Option 3: Rebuild with new migration but keep database data
If you want to rebuild migration files but keep the existing database:
Delete the Migrations folder
Run:
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Infrastructure -s API --ignore-changes
This will re-create migration files without re-applying changes to the DB.
⚠️ Summary:
If migration not applied yet → dotnet ef migrations remove.
If applied and want fresh start → drop DB + delete Migrations folder + re-create.
If DB should stay → --ignore-changes.
