get pid of certain database and kill it's opens sessions:
(Example)
SELECT pid FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'postgres';

for example it will give us wo pid:
  pid
-------
 10168 (adminstrator pid (we can kill this one))
  5532
(2 rows)
Then we have it's open sessions and we can kill all pid sessions of this database
by this Command:
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(12345);(the only point is that we can not kill adminstrator pid)

or we can kill all pids of all opened sessions of all databases
by this command if we need to stop all background process:
(for game_dev DB for example)

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'game_dev' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
