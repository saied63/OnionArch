What Is DbContext?
DbContext is the bridge between your C# code and your
database. 
It tracks your entities,
manages queries,
and handles saving changes.

Example :
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using OnionGolmehr.Domain.Entities; // namesapece of entities
public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    // set tables from entits
    public DbSet<Country> Countries { get; set; }
    public DbSet<City> Cities { get; set; }
    // primay Constructor to make path options to base (base = DbContext)
    public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options) : base(options) { }
    // in OnModelCreating we will ?
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Fluent API configuration goes here
    }
}

DbContext change tracking (how EF knows what to do)

Core idea: DbContext keeps a Change Tracker. Each entity has a State:
Added, Modified, Deleted, Unchanged, Detached.

When states change

Add: context.Add(entity) ‚Üí Added ‚Üí INSERT on SaveChanges().

Modify: Change a tracked entity‚Äôs property ‚Üí Modified ‚Üí UPDATE on SaveChanges().

Delete: context.Remove(entity) ‚Üí Deleted ‚Üí DELETE on SaveChanges().

Unchanged: After SaveChanges(), tracker resets to Unchanged.

Detached: Not tracked (e.g., new object not attached, or AsNoTracking() query).


//********* important note when optimizeation is matter *******//:
// 
as a start point whwn we don't know where we should use tracjing and when not, go ahead by default : 
context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = true; // default
and just when we don't need too modify list and only want to get and show them use
var readOnly  = await context.Users.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync(); 
to ignore tracked entity and just get it for view;
//
read carfully : 

should i use untracked mode somewhere or i can go ahead by changeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled() alway? because it seems faster and simpler

Great question üëç you‚Äôre digging into the core performance mechanics of EF Core! Let‚Äôs break it down carefully before you decide whether to use NoTracking or always rely on ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled.

üîπ How EF Core Tracks Changes

Tracked entities: When you load entities normally (context.Users.ToList()), EF attaches them to the ChangeTracker. Any changes (property updates, deletes, adds) are monitored. When you call SaveChanges(), EF compares current vs original values and generates SQL accordingly.

Untracked entities: If you use .AsNoTracking() or globally configure NoTracking, EF doesn‚Äôt monitor changes. You still get your objects, but EF won‚Äôt know if you changed them ‚Üí you‚Äôd have to manually tell EF what to update/insert/delete.

AutoDetectChangesEnabled: This is about when EF checks for modifications.

Default = true ‚Üí EF scans tracked entities automatically before SaveChanges(), Add, Update, etc.

If you set it false, you must manually call context.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges() when you want EF to check.

Used in high-performance scenarios (e.g., bulk inserts) where constant scanning is wasteful.

üîπ When to Use Each
1. NoTracking (AsNoTracking)

‚úîÔ∏è Best when:

You just read data and don‚Äôt need to update it.

Example: showing product list on a shopping site.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not good when:

You plan to modify the entities later. You‚Äôd need to Attach or Update them manually.

2. Tracked (default, with AutoDetectChangesEnabled = true)

‚úîÔ∏è Best when:

You are doing typical CRUD: load ‚Üí modify ‚Üí save.

Keeps life simple for most apps.

‚ö†Ô∏è Performance cost:

EF scans all tracked entities before saving ‚Üí noticeable only with large graphs (tens of thousands of entities).

3. Tracked with AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false

‚úîÔ∏è Best when:

You insert/update/delete thousands of rows in one go (e.g., importing CSV of 50k users).

You don‚Äôt want EF to re-scan everything after each Add() call.

You‚Äôll call DetectChanges() once, just before SaveChanges().

‚ö†Ô∏è Not good when:

You forget to call DetectChanges(). EF may miss updates.

üîπ Rule of Thumb

Normal apps (like ours now) ‚Üí just use tracked (default).

Read-only queries ‚Üí add .AsNoTracking() for small performance win.

Bulk operations ‚Üí disable AutoDetectChanges, do your work, then call DetectChanges() manually.

‚úÖ So: You don‚Äôt have to choose only one approach forever.

For our professional project, we‚Äôll default to tracked (so we don‚Äôt miss changes).

We‚Äôll sprinkle AsNoTracking where queries are clearly read-only.

Later, if we hit performance issues, we‚Äôll optimize with AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false for batch ops.
