one of the most important questions in backend development — 
and understanding this will make your architecture clean, scalable
, and professional.

🧱 What Are Entities, Models, and DTOs?
Let’s break them down clearly:

1. Entities (Domain Layer)

Represent core business objects.
Usually map directly to database tables.
Contain business logic and relationships.

Example:

public class WeatherForecast
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureC { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }
}

2. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) (Contracts Layer)

Used to send or receive data between layers or over the network.
Contain only the data needed for a specific operation.
Help protect your domain from being exposed directly.

Example:

public class WeatherForecastDto
{
    public DateOnly Date { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureC { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);
}

3. Models (Presentation Layer)

Used in the UI or frontend.
Can be similar to DTOs but may include UI-specific formatting, validation, or display logic.

✅ Why Use DTOs Instead of Entities?
🔒 Security	Prevents exposing sensitive fields (like Id, UserId, etc.)
🎯 Precision	Sends only the data needed — not the whole entity
🔄 Decoupling	Keeps your domain logic separate from transport logic
🧪 Validation & Shaping	DTOs can be shaped for specific views or use cases
🔄 Versioning	Easier to evolve APIs without breaking internal logic

🧠 When to Use Each ?

Layer	           Use This Type	        Purpose
Domain	           Entities	                Business logic, database mapping
Application/API	   DTOs	                    Input/output for services and endpoints
UI/Frontend	       Models or DTOs	        Display and user interaction

🔧 Example Flow in Your Weather API
Entity: WeatherForecast in Domain(layer)
DTO: WeatherForecastDto in Contracts(layer)
Controller: Maps entity → DTO and returns it

Frontend: Receives DTO and displays it
